The-Lost-Vessel
===============
Game Information
-----------------------------
###I.  Game Overview 
The lost vessel is a game where the user is a scuba diver looking for a lost vessel. The user is faced with scenarios in which he needs to decide on what to do next. His decision will affect the outcome of the game. There are 8 possible outcomes in this game. Seven of which are negative outcomes. The negative outcomes cause the user to lose the game while the positive outcome makes the user win the game. Every time the game is played, the user always has 12.5% chance of winning the game (1/8). The reason that the positive outcome is randomly assigned is to make the game unpredictable.

###II.  Game Play Mechanics
The user is always given an option depending on the scenario. Whatever the user decides to choose will be used to determine what the outcome is. When the user is deciding for the second decision (after getting in the ship) he has the option to go back outside the ship. But after the third decision is selected, the game will then be over and the outcome will be shown.

###III.	Story Index
The story is about you as a scuba diver in search of a lost vessel in the middle of the Pacific. The game begins after you found the vessel that matches the description you are looking for. You then decided to investigate the vessel. And this is where your adventure begins.

###IV.	Future Features
Add an actual GUI for this game.
Add more decision nodes.
Add special items that can be used to help the user win. 

Test Information
-----------------------------
###I.	The ship testing
Used to check how many times the user wins the game. The main purpose of this file is to make sure that the user gets a fair chance of winning the game after randomly setting the positive outcome. It shows how many times the user may win the game after 100 tries. 

###II.	Test-data file
A CSV file where the data generated when the test is run is saved. Each time the test is executed, the contents of this file will change. The reason this file is added in Github is to show real data to anyone who wants to look into how many times a user will win the game.
